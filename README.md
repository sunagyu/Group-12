## 👥 Team Roles & Responsibilities

This project is a collaborative effort by **Group 12**. Below are the assigned roles and task distributions:

| Member | Role | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nurin** | **Project Admin / Owner** | Project management, Repository setup, `/introduction`, `/report`, and `/requirements` overview. |
| **Haziq** | **Requirements Analyst** | Defining 5 Functional and 3 Non-functional requirements in the `/requirements` folder. |

| **Darwish** | **Visual Designer** | Creating and organizing visual logic diagrams in the `/flowcharts` folder. |

## 🛠 Workflow Strategy
* **Branching:** Each member works on their specific `dev-` branch (e.g., `dev-flowcharts`) to keep drafts separate from the final report.
* **Peer Review:** All work is moved to the `main` branch via **Pull Requests**, where the Project Admin reviews and merges the content.
* **Task Tracking:** We use GitHub **Issues** to assign and track the progress of each module.
